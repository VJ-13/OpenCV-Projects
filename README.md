# OpenCV-Projects

## Basic Folder
The Basics Folder: This folder contains a comprehensive collection of fundamental concepts and techniques required to work with OpenCV. It covers a range of essential topics, including blur, bitwise operations, masking, contour detection, drawing shapes, and working with gradients. These foundational elements served me as building blocks for more advanced computer vision projects.

## Face Recognizer Folder
Face Recognizer: Within this folder, you'll find a project dedicated to facial recognition using OpenCV. It has been trained on approximately 20 photos of each celebrity, leveraging the power of Haar cascades, a popular object detection technique in OpenCV. By employing Haar cascades, the FaceRecognizer is capable of accurately identifying and recognizing faces in images.

## Hand Tracking Folder
This folder focuses on the detection and tracking of hand movements using the mediapipe library. By utilizing mediapipe, the project is able to identify various hand poses and gestures, placing reference points on different muscles and landmarks of the hand. This allows for real-time monitoring and analysis of hand movements, which can be useful in a wide range of applications
